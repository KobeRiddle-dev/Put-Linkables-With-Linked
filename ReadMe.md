# Put Linkables With Linked

Moves linkables (like the tool cabinet) to the same category as the things they link to (usually Production).

Supports [Better Architect Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3563882422)! The linkables will be moved to the correct subcategories if it's installed.

## Recommended mods: 

- My other mod [Clean Categories: Extended](), especially if you are using Vanilla Factions Expanded: Medieval 2.
- Ferny's [Better Architect Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3563882422)
